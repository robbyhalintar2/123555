## Introduction

MargarineBot is a multi-purpose Discord bot that ranges in features such as server moderation, to an economy system using a SQLite database, to starboards, and much more. MargarineBot also features highly customizable settings for your guild to personalize and maximize his potential in your server!

Created through part-desire, part-what can I do in Discord, part-I'm going to learn Javascript, and part-it's only midnight thoughts, MargarineBot has been my personal project for several years now. For the amount of time and effort I've spent, I'm quite proud of my work and the functionality I've be able to pull off. Ever since the start of his development, I've recieved plenty of support and can't thank those people enough. As without it, Margarine would never be as big or as good as he is today. So, take a look... get some inspiration... just be sure to enjoy Margarine as much as I do.

### Name Origin
My typical nickname is Butter, as in the stuff that you put on toast. His name comes from the artificial butter (I tends to call it 'Fake Butter') you can buy in stores called, Margarine.
